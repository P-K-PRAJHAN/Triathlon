        <h1>The Quest for the Lost Treasure</h1><br><br>
        <h2>Story Introduction:</h2>
        <p>In a small town nestled between towering mountains and lush forests, Alex discovers an ancient map hidden in the attic of their grandparent's house. The map speaks of a legendary treasure buried deep within the Enchanted Forest. Fueled by curiosity and a thirst for adventure, Alex decides to embark on a quest to find the treasure, setting the stage for an unforgettable journey.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Into the Enchanted Forest</h2>
        <p>As dawn breaks, Alex gathers supplies and steps into the dense greenery of the Enchanted Forest. The air is filled with the sounds of chirping birds and rustling leaves. The map indicates two possible paths: one leading deeper into the dark and mysterious part of the forest, and the other towards a glimmering stream that promises to be serene but possibly unhelpful in the treasure hunt.</p>
        <p>The trees loom high above, their branches intertwining to block out most of the sunlight. As Alex walks cautiously, a rustling sound draws their attention. Suddenly, a wild boar appears, blocking the path ahead. Alex knows they need to act quickly.</p>
        <p>Realizing the danger, Alex retreats quietly. However, in their haste, they trip and fall, landing in a patch of mud. As they scramble to get up, they notice a strange marking on a nearby tree that looks like part of the map.<br><br><b>What should Alex do?</b></p>
        <a href=""><b>D1.</b> Study the marking closely.</a><br><br>
        <a href=""><b>D2.</b> Keep moving away from the dark path.</a>
